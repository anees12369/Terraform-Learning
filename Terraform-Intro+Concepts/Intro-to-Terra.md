# **Introduction to Terraform and Infrastructure as Code**

- Terraform is a tool that you can use to deploy  resources in the cloud (AWS) **in the form of code,** instead of doing it manually.

- For example, deploying an EC2 instance **through code**

- Terraform is a **cloud-agnostic tool,** it can deploy to many different cloud providers.

- This is done is through the **Terraform registry** where it will install certain plugins, then use certain API calls in order to be able to deploy to different providers.

- In this case, we will be focusing on what that looks like when deploying things to **AWS Cloud.**
